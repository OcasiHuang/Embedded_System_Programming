Setup the Galileo2 board, also connect USB mouse to Galileo2

How to execute:

0. Please modify MOUSEFILE path in RGBLed_usr_tst.c, line 19
1. type "make all"
2. scp all the ko and o files to Galileo2

Following parts are executed in Galileo2:

2. insmod RGBLed.ko
3. type "./test.o"

Description:

All modules in user space are integrated into RGBLed.c while all modules in kernel space are integrated in RGBLed.c. As "./test.o" is entered, the  will be activated and run.
First, the executing program will ask user to enter the period of PWM, 
which will control the luminous intensity of blinking LED. Then, the program will ask user to input GPIO output of R,G,B respectively, if the input is invalid(include GPIO7&GPIO8), the program will terminate immediately.

If all input GPIO pad is legal, the LED should start blinking in [R,G,B,RG,RB,GB,RGB] sequence, each kind of light will last 0.5sec.

The simulation will end when user click left or right button of mouse.
